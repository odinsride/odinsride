### Hi there 👋

I'm Kevin Custer. I build things with Rails in my spare time, and with ServiceNow at work.

### I'm currently working on ...

* **[olubalance](https://olubalance.com)** - A personal finance app that has helped my wife and I pay off debts and become financially responsible.  It is a Rails 6 app and uses Postgres, Webpack, Stimulus, and Bulma.  I've learned a lot building it and currently working on a complete rewrite using the knowledge and patterns I've learned about while working on the original version.
* Building a self-hosted personal cloud, powered by Debian, Docker, and Tailscale
* Freelance opportunities: Wordpress, Shopify, Custom development, and finding the best solutions for clients

### Tech Interests (besides web development!)

* Linux
* Docker
* Virtualization
* Homelabbing and Self hosting
* Hardware / PC building
