### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kevin Custer. I build things with **Rails**, **JavaScript**, and **Python** in my spare time, and with _ServiceNow_ at work.

### I'm currently working on ...

* **[olubalance](https://github.com/odinsride/olubalance)** - A personal finance app that has helped my wife and I pay off debts and become financially responsible.  It is a Rails app backed by Postgres, esbuild, Hotwire/Stimulus, and Bulma CSS.  I've learned a lot building it and continue to add features and enhancements.
